# UFOs

## Overview
This webpage was designed to showcase documented sightings of UFOs in various states between 1/1/2010 and 1/13/2010. The first version of the webpage allowed for filtering based on date alongside a button to execute the search. To accomodate more search criterias, I revamped the search function to allow for searches based on date, city, state, country, and shape without a button to execute the search. 


## Results
The initial build of the website only allowed for filtering by date which was executed by entering a date and clicking a button. With recent development, users are now able to filter by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

### How to Perform a Search

To perform a search, the user must enter their desired search criteria in the appropriate filter. For example, to perform a search for all UFO sightings in Texas, the user would enter 'tx' in state filter text box.

With 'tx' typed in the state filter text box, the user would then press their 'Enter' or 'Return' key to initiate the search or clicking into any open area of the page. Upon doing so, results based on the search critiera will be returned. In this case, the results below would be all UFO sightings in Texas.

It must be mentioned that users can filter on multiple criterias. For example, to perform a seearch for all UFO sightings in California in the shape of triangles, the user would enter 'ca' in the state filter text box and enter 'triangle' in the shape filter text box, and then press enter to return the results or clicking any open area on the page. Below is an image of a few of the results of UFO sightings in California with the shape of triangles.

## Summary

The webpage is responsive and quick to filter by the user's input which is great. One of the drawbacks of the page is the that the filter is case-sensitive meaning the user's desired filter input must be entered in all lowercase or else the table won't return any results. Possibly, in future development, adding a function to automatically lower case all user inputs to avoid this issue is a solution. From a functional standpoint, the webpage works as intended. However, from aesthetic point of view, the website is quite bland. I would add further styling elements or changes to page such as fixing aligning column elements, adding more images, and styling word text.
